Turning somebodyâ€™s gist for a monotonic GAM into a package
(experimental).

Based on
<https://gist.github.com/willtownes/f598e5c2344043675566603d29b6c2d6>

I make no representations about this package, use at your own risk.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gzt/monomgcv")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to fit a monotonic GAM with
two different settings for knots based on the existing example code in
`mgcv`.

``` r
library(monomgcv)
set.seed(20200410)
x <- runif(100) * 4 - 1
x <- sort(x)
f <- exp(4 * x) / (1 + exp(4 * x))
y <- f + rnorm(100) * 0.1
plot(x, y)
 fv <- mspline(x, y, 5)
lines(x, predict(fv, x), col = "red")
fv <- mspline(x, y, 10)
lines(x, predict(fv, x), col = "blue")
legend("bottomright", lty = 1, paste0("k=", c(5, 10)),
       col = c("red", "blue"))
```
